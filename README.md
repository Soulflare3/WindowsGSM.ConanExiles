🧩 A plugin version of the Conan Exiles Dedicated server for WindowsGSM

## Notes
To use the legacy version https://github.com/Raziel7893/WindowsGSM.ConanExilesLegacy
- If you get issues with outdated versions:
  - Go to ConanSandbox\Saved\Config\WindowsServer\Engine
  - Delete the lines:
  * bUseBuildIdOverride=True
  * BuildIdOverride=XXXXXXX

## Mod AutoUpdate (only steammods possible)
- Just copy your ModList.txt to the ServerFiles root (click Browse => serverfiles) and click update.
- WGSM will try to load all the mods from steam and copy them into the Mods folder.
- If you need to change the order: edit that file. the Plugin will recreate the ConanExilesSandbox/Mods/Modlist.txt after each update

## Portforwardings:
You need this to connect from anywhere outside your local home
If You don't know How: https://portforward.com/router.htm , search the list for your router and you should get an howto
- 7777 UDP (gameport)
- 7778 UDP (should be GamePort +1 if changed)
- 27016 UDP OR TCP( QueryPort, not sure about the protocol there, should be udp)

### Not having an full IPv4 adress ( named CCNAT or DSL Light )
No game or gameserver supports ipv6 only connections. 
- You need to either buy one (most VPN services provide that option. A pal uses ovpn.net for his server, I know of nordvpn also providing that. Should both cost around 7€ cheaper half of it, if your already having an VPN)
- Or you pay a bit more for your internet and take a contract with full ipv4. (depending on your country)
- There are also tunneling methods, which require acces to a server with a full ipv4. Some small VPS can be obtained, not powerfull enough for the servers themself, but only for forwarding. I think there are some for under 5€), the connection is then done via wireguard. but its a bit configuration heavy to setup) 

Or you connect your friends via VPN to your net and play via local lan then.
Many windowsgsm plugin creators recommend zerotier (should be a free VPN designated for gaming) , see chapter below (or tailscale, but no howto there)

## How can you play with your friends without port forwarding?
- Use [zerotier](https://www.zerotier.com/) folow the basic guide and create network
- Download the client app and join to your network
- Create static IP address for your host machine
- Edit WGSM IP Address to your recently created static IP address
- Give your network ID to your friends
- After they've joined to your network
- They can connect using the IP you've created eg: 10.123.17.1:7777
- Enjoy
